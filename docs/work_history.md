# Work History

This document tracks the history of work completed on the AutoOps project.

## 2025-04-21

### Initial Project Setup
- Created project structure with backend and frontend directories
- Set up Node.js with Express for the backend
- Initialized TypeScript configuration
- Set up Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Created initial database schema with models for:
  - Users
  - ProcessedEmails
  - KnowledgeBase
  - Responses
- Implemented basic authentication middleware
- Created route handlers for:
  - Authentication
  - Email processing
  - Knowledge base management
  - Response generation
- Set up OpenAI service for embeddings and response generation
- Created utility functions for language detection and logging
- Set up project documentation

### Technology Decisions
- Chose TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Selected Prisma ORM for database interactions
- Decided to use pgvector for vector embeddings in PostgreSQL
- Opted for direct Gmail API integration instead of storing emails in the database
- Selected Next.js for the frontend for its server-side rendering capabilities

### Challenges Encountered
- Setting up pgvector with Prisma required custom SQL queries
- Gmail API integration requires careful handling of authentication and refresh tokens
- Vector search implementation needed special consideration in the database schema

### Next Steps
- Complete the response controller implementation
- Set up frontend project structure
- Implement database migrations
- Create initial UI components for the admin dashboard
