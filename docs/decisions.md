# Project Decisions

This document tracks key decisions made during the development of the AutoOps project, along with the rationale behind each decision.

## Architecture Decisions

### Backend Framework: Node.js with Express and TypeScript
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need to select a backend framework that is efficient, scalable, and maintainable.
**Decision:** Use Node.js with Express and TypeScript.
**Rationale:** 
- TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience
- Node.js offers excellent performance for I/O-bound operations like API calls
- Express is a mature, well-documented framework with a large ecosystem
- The combination allows for rapid development while maintaining code quality

### Database: PostgreSQL with pgvector
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need a database that can store structured data and support vector embeddings for semantic search.
**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with pgvector extension.
**Rationale:**
- PostgreSQL is a robust, mature relational database
- pgvector extension provides efficient vector operations for embeddings
- Relational model fits well with the structured nature of our data
- Strong ecosystem and tooling support

### ORM: Prisma
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need an ORM that works well with TypeScript and PostgreSQL.
**Decision:** Use Prisma ORM.
**Rationale:**
- First-class TypeScript support with auto-generated types
- Intuitive API with strong type safety
- Good migration system for schema changes
- Active development and community support

### Email Integration: Direct Gmail API
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need to decide whether to store emails in the database or access them directly from Gmail.
**Decision:** Use Gmail API directly without storing full email content in the database.
**Rationale:**
- Reduces duplication of data
- Ensures access to the most up-to-date email content
- Simplifies compliance with data protection regulations
- Leverages Gmail's storage and search capabilities

### Frontend Framework: React with Next.js
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need a frontend framework that supports server-side rendering and has good TypeScript integration.
**Decision:** Use React with Next.js.
**Rationale:**
- Server-side rendering improves performance and SEO
- Strong TypeScript support
- Built-in routing and API routes
- Good developer experience with hot reloading

### AI Integration: OpenAI API
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need AI capabilities for generating embeddings and email responses.
**Decision:** Use OpenAI API.
**Rationale:**
- State-of-the-art language models
- Simple API integration
- Support for embeddings and text generation
- Multilingual capabilities

## Implementation Decisions

### Authentication: JWT-based
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need a stateless authentication mechanism for the API.
**Decision:** Use JWT-based authentication.
**Rationale:**
- Stateless operation fits well with API architecture
- Simple to implement and use
- Good library support in Node.js
- Allows for role-based access control

### Email Processing: Webhook-based
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need to decide how to trigger email processing.
**Decision:** Use webhook-based processing triggered by Gmail notifications.
**Rationale:**
- Real-time processing of new emails
- Reduces need for polling
- More efficient use of resources
- Better user experience with faster response times

### Vector Search Implementation: Custom SQL
**Decision Date:** 2023-04-21
**Context:** Need to implement vector search with Prisma and pgvector.
**Decision:** Use custom SQL queries through Prisma's $queryRaw.
**Rationale:**
- Prisma doesn't natively support vector operations
- Custom SQL allows for efficient vector queries
- Maintains type safety through Prisma's $queryRaw
- Allows for complex vector operations like nearest neighbor search
