# AutoOps Project Overview

## Project Description
AutoOps is an automated operations system designed to streamline and automate various operational tasks for GizAI. The initial focus is on automating email support responses based on a knowledge base built from previous emails, with the ability to expand to other operational tasks in the future.

## Vision
Create a flexible, scalable automation platform that can handle various operational tasks for GizAI, starting with email support automation. The system should be able to learn from past interactions and improve over time, reducing manual workload while maintaining high-quality customer service.

## Key Objectives
1. Automate email response generation for support@giz.ai
2. Build a knowledge base from previous email interactions
3. Support multiple languages in responses
4. Create a user-friendly interface for reviewing and sending draft responses
5. Design the system to be extensible for future automation needs

## Technology Stack
